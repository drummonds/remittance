Remittance
==========

Python interface for remittances. Eg XLS spreadsheets from AIS

This is a collection of tools that I have used for helping my day to day work with AIS

### Installing a module locally

An aide memoire for me You need a command line like this: 'pip install git+file://C:/it/majorprojects/remittance'
